Because of this, we want to reconstruct the photo with the smallest possible number of trials."

    "Now that we have a way to reconstruct images, we need to set up an optimization procedure to find a person that will be the most similar to the one we are thinking about. To do so, we need to set up some scoring utility. Imagine that you want to generate an image of Brad Pitt. You start with a small number of random samples, say 5, and rank them according to their similarity to your vision of Brad Pitt: 1 for the worst, 5 for the best. You then rate image by image using GPyOpt that works in a latent space of VAE. For the new image, you need to somehow assign a real number that will show how good this image is. The simple idea is to ask a user to compare a new image with previous images (along with their scores). A user then enters score to a current image.\n",

    "We first start with a random pick of 10 samples from which we get the images using the decoder of the VAE. We ask the user to score the ten images on a scale from 0 to 9 depending on the objective they have (eg: lecturer, darkest hair). Once the scoring of the images is done, we select the top 5 images to use as initialization of the bayesian optimization process. A sample is then generated by the optimizer, displayed to the user for scoring. This process is done 10 times. At each iteration, the optimizer takes into account the new rating to generate the next candidate. At the end, the best rated image is selected.\n",

    "Faces are complicated to describe, for more complicated queries the optimizer has hard time finding what features to optimize when it come to answer more complex queries, like finding the lecturer.

When we want to reconstruct faces with more details than a simple hair color or smile, the current system of user feedback might be too poor to express those complicated features."
