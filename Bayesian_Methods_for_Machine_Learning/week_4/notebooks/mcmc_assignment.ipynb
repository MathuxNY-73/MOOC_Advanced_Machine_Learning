    "If we have a binary random variable $y$ (which may indicate whether a person makes \\\\$50K) and if the probabilty of the positive outcome $p(y = 1)$ is for example 0.8, we will say that the *odds* are 4 to 1 (or just 4 for short), because succeding is 4 time more likely than failing $\\frac{p(y = 1)}{p(y = 0)} = \\frac{0.8}{0.2} = 4$.\n",
    "\n",

Let's compute the **ratio** between the odds of a male having salary $\\geq $ \\\\$50K and the odds of a female (with the same level of education, experience and everything else) having salary $\\geq$ \\\\$50K. The first feature of each person in the dataset is gender. Specifically, $x_{i1} = 0$ if the person is female and $x_{i1} = 1$ otherwise. Consider two people $i$ and $j$ having all but one features the same with the only difference in $x_{i1} \\neq x_{j1}$.\n",

But of course, even if all the logistic regression assumptions are met we cannot estimate the coefficient exactly from real-world data, it's just too noisy. So it would be really nice to build an interval estimate, which would tell us something along the lines \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 0.8 and less than 1.2, so we cannot conclude that there is any gender discrimination in the salaries\" (or vice versa, that \"with probability 0.95 the odds ratio is greater than 1.5 and less than 1.9 and the discrimination takes place because a male has at least 1.5 higher probability to get >$50k than a female with the same level of education, age, etc.\").
